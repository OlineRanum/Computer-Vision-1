    "## General Guidelines\n",
    "Your code and discussion must be completed in this **jupyter notebook** before the deadline by submitting it to the Canvas Lab 3 Assignment. Submit your assignment in a **zip file**, with all the relevant files and images need to run your notebook. Name your zip file as follows:  **StudentID1_StudentID2_StudentID3.zip**\n",
    "For full credit, make sure your answers follow these guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure you use the provided python environment. You can create the environment using conda and the provided YAML file using the following command: `conda env create --file=CV1_env.yaml`, then activate it as `conda activate cv1`. Using different packages versions may result in the impossibility to run the submitted code and therefore in the subtraction of points. Below you will find a code cell to check the versions of your packages. \n",
    "- Please express your thoughts concisely. The number of words does not necessarily correlate with how well you understand the concepts.\n",
    "- Answer all given questions (in **<font color=green >Question** parts). Briefly describe what you implemented. **<font color=blue >Hint** parts are there to give you hints to answer questions.\n",
    "- Try to understand the problem as much as you can. When answering a question, give evidence (qualitative and/or quantitative results, references to papers, etc.) to support your arguments. Note that not everything might be explicitly asked for and you are expected to think about what might strengthen you arguments and make your notebook self-contained and complete.\n",
    "- Analyze your results and discuss them, e.g. why algorithm A works better than algorithm B in a certain problem.\n",
    "- Tables and figures must be accompanied by a brief description. Do not forget to add a number, a title, and if applicable name and unit of variables in a table, name and unit of axes and legends in a figure.\n",
    "- Make sure all the code in your notebook runs without errors or bugs before submitting. Code that does not run can result in a lower grade. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Late submissions** are not allowed. Assignments that are submitted after the strict deadline will not be graded. In case of submission conflicts, TAs’ system clock is taken as reference. We strongly recommend submitting well in advance, to avoid last minute system failure issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plagiarism note:** Keep in mind that plagiarism (submitted materials which are not your work) is a serious crime and any misconduct shall be punished with the university regulations."

    "<b>Answer:</b> After testing with 45 and 90 degrees it can be concluded that Harris Corner Detection (HCD) is indeed rotation invariant. This is also obvious from the method itself. HCD looks at the distribution of image gradients for an image. An edge is defined by a large derivative in a single direction; i.e. an edge in the x-direction will have a large response when taking the derivative in the y-direction. A corner, however, is defined by two edges connecting at a point/angle. The more this angle heads towards 90 degrees, the bigger the spread between the derivatives in the x- and y-direction becomes. \n",

    "Optical flow is the apparent motion of image pixels or regions from one frame to the next, which results from moving objects in the image or from camera motion. Underlying optical flow is typically an assumption of $\\textit{brightness constancy}$. That is the image values (brightness, color, etc) remain constant over time, though their 2D position in the image may change. Algorithms for estimating optical flow exploit this assumption in various ways to compute a velocity field that describes the horizontal and vertical motion of every pixel in the image. For a 2D+t dimensional case a voxel at location $(x, y, t)$ with intensity $I(x, y, t)$ will have moved by $\\delta_x$, $\\delta_y$ and $\\delta_t$ between the two image frames, and the following image constraint equation can be given:\n",

    "\n",
    "Optical flow is difficult to compute for two main reasons. First, in image regions that are roughly homogeneous, the optical flow is ambiguous, because the brightness constancy assumption is satisfied by many different motions. Second, in real scenes, the assumption is violated at motion boundaries and by miscellaneous lighting, non-rigid motions, shadows, transparency, reflections, etc. To address the former, all optical flow methods make some sort of assumption about the spatial variation of the optical flow that is used to resolve the ambiguity. Those are just assumptions about the world which are approximate and consequently may lead to errors in the flow estimates. The latter problem can be addressed by making much richer but more complicated assumptions about the changing image brightness or, more commonly, using robust statistical methods which can deal with 'violations' of the brightness constancy assumption."

    "# 2.2 Lucas-Kanade vs. Horn-Schunck method \n",
    "\n",
    "The Lucas Kanade (LK) and the Horn-Schunck (HS) methods both aim to estimate the optical flow between frames, but differ in their ground assumptions and approaches towards calculating the optical flow vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2.1 Global and Local methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The LK method assumes that flow is constant in a local neighborhood, and as such assumes that the optical flow equation (Eq. 18) holds for all pixels in that local region (Eq. 21). The optical flow equation is then solved by the least squares criterion (Eq. 22) [1]. In this sense, the LK approach operates at a local scale, as it only utilize information in the neighborhood defined by a fixed size tile. In particular, LK estimates the average motion of such a tile using the tiles' spatial intensity gradient information and the time derivative between the consecutive frames. However, exactly how 'local' the method can claim to be depends on the size of one tile and the total image size relative to the motion depicted by the frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Horn-Schunck method is on the other hand a global method that assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly everywhere in the image. After imposing this global smoothness constraint, the method tries to minimize a global energy function expressed as the full spatial integral over all the derivatives of the intensity in every pixel, weighted with the optical flow vector and a regularization constant. The energy function is then minimized by solving the corresponding set of multi-dimensional Euler-Lagrange equations [2]. The velocity components of each pixel that define the optical flow vector which minimizes the energy function is selected as estimators. In this sense, the HS method is truly global in that the optical velocities at each pixel is estimated using the joint information from all pixels in the frames simultaneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2.2 Behavior in flat regions \n",
    "The global method (HS) and more local approach (LK) differ in their behavior in flat regions. A flat region is a region where all the derivatives are (approximately) zero, i.e. homogeneous image patches with approximately constant intensity. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the flow vectors are estimated using LK, a flat region across two consecutive image frames will suffer from the aperture problem. As the method only consider local information with a fixed window size it becomes very hard to detect wether there are no motion between two consecutive frames in a flat region, or wether the flat patch is part of a feature in motion which range is exceeding the neighborhood. The latter can yield a net zero result for the local flow vector, while in fact it should have had the same value as its' neighboring flow vectors where motion can be detected due to the presence of a boundary. This is illustrated in the calculations above. For the sphere and the synth motion the LK does a decent job of finding the flow vectors. It can be seen by looking at the tile separation illustrations for these two motives that there are few flat regions used in the estimations. Given that thethe texture of the sphere and the synth varies to a relative high degree it is almost always possible to measure some variation in the intensity. In the case of the Monkaa motive the situation is more complicated, as the presence of flat regions appear to be higher for some areas, and the relative motion quite drastic in other regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the area does not contain any of the edges perpendicular to the movement, the gradient will be singular, and you will not be able to estimate the optical flow. The HS method fixes the aperture problem, as its global methodology minimizes the energy function in all pixels simultaneously, as such all flow vectors contain information about the entire environment of the image, and not just that which is contained in a local neighborhood. There is no risk of excluding a boundary by selecting the wrong window size of selecting a neighborhood containing only the flat region or a feature that in fact is in motion between the frames. However, such a method is also more sensitive to noise and relative motion differences than local methods like the LK, due to the impact of the global nature of the methodology on the final results of all flow vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "*In conclusion*, while the LK method is likely a good and sufficient approach for motives such as the sphere and the synth, it is probably a better idea to use global methods such as HK when handling motives like monkaa where the texture regions and relative motions between neighborhoods are more complicated. \n",
